# React Projects

The following repository will be a few different projects that I will be working over the next few weeks to get back into my software development career.

## Purpose

The aim of these projects is to upskill and just go back to basics after a year of sales related work, its good to see if I still have it.

At the time of writing, React is my least favourite Lnaguage/Framework for working with JavaScript. So what do you do next?
**You lean into the hard stuff, because being able to do the hard stuff is what will make you great**

All the projects that I work on will probably be tutorials, that I will ensure I credit properly.
