# React ToDo App with TypeScript

This is a simple ToDo app built with React and TypeScript. It is a part of my portfolio projects, to demonstrate my skillset in React and TypeScript.

In today's JavaScript landscape, TypeScript is gaining more and more popularity,
and React developers need to embracing it.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project in your local development environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sibo-dev/reactProjects.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

   ```bash
   cd reactProjects/todo
   ```

3. Open the cloned folder in your preferred code editor, install the required dependencies by running the following command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

You are now ready to go!
